#IF YOU'RE READING THIS, YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED BY REV!**

Led culture is infamous for its creativity. Neopixels are a brilliant medium for beauty.
Rev's Blinkin' LED driver is a substitute for this art form that allowed clever homages to pixel art
and arcade cabinets.
It is everything we hate as programmers.

But if we must use it, we will survive. As long as it has a Larson Scanner pattern (think of those spoopy Cyclon dudes)
we will survive. But without geek-chic references.

#SOULLESS RGBS GO BRRRRRR

There are two-dollar chips that splash junky patterns over lights.

They're pretty cheap... (an infamous one is used in everything from Disney balloons to LED lightsabers! 
TOY ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED! and it's utterly undocumented, too!)  

So Rev 'solved' all our RGB problems (that any freaking Dotstar could do!) by providing us with yet-another dubiously
built plastic monstrosity that controls RGBs by reprogramming it as if it was a servo- set it to a direction and the lights go blink
(assuming you got a 1 meter with individually addressable LEDs instead of a derped, solid-color 5 meter- it's tempting!) 

AND it has THE most blursed product name in history: The Blinkin' (yes, that's a contraction and no, it isn't the word *blinkenlights*)
LED Driver!

#THE PROBLEM?

REV has once again published a trashy library. Sample the SampleRevBlinkinLedDriver.
It's MADNESS. Any library for aesthetic hardware should have 3 things:
AN INIT CALL 
A SIMPLE 'SET PATTERN'
**AND** an 'update' method!!
HARDWARE SHOULD BE DEFINED IN THE FILE AND IT SHOULD BE WELL DOCUMENTED!

Rev has supplied none of the above.
With my work, it should be three lines to operate your new Blinkin' Led Driver.

GOODBYE, REV.

We all know lights are a better output method than a console.

Leds are no more an Existential Rainbow Of Dread, suitable only for the best and the dumbest teams, they are a contrivance that anyone should
be able to operate who can write Kotlin.
